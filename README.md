# DnDBuddy
A helpful companion for DMing games!

# What is this?
I want to host my own One Shot, but found that organization of ideas was 
difficult. Enter DnDBuddy! This app will eventually be able to:
- Read in a text file such as notes or a script and display them in a GUI
  - Allow for Hover behavior to peek at specified notes in the provided text
  - Quick access to all other notes across your campaign are merely a click away!
- Allow you to set specific music and sound effects for a particular scene
  - Includes fade ins, fade outs, and volume controls
- Keep track of Initiative, turn order, health, and more all from a single interface
