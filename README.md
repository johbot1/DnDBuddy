# DnDBuddy
A helpful companion for DMing games!

# What is this?
I want to host my own One Shot, but found that there were things that would be best made myself. Enter: DnD Buddies!
These DnD buddies will have very specific purposes:
- ### Groove Buddy:
  - Will be able to load in an MP3 file, set time stamps, and be able to dynamically loop/play music
  - (Stretch Goal: Have a way to save configuration files to better allow for easier load-in)
- ### Puzzle Buddy:
  - Able to show a simplistic view of a puzzle, and allow for realtime interactions for players
    - (First puzzle: Chromatic Cypher a la Resident Evil 4 Church Puzzle)

# Requirements:
### Ant Requirement:
Apache Ant is a build tool to quickly run java files from the command line.
Instructions for install found at: https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html  
To ensure you have Ant installed and properly running use the following command 
to check your installation version: `ant -v` or `ant --version`

## How To Run:
